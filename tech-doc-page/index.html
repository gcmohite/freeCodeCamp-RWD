        </header>
        <p>
          Git is the world's most popular version control system. A
          <strong>Version Control System</strong> is software that tracks and
          manages changes to files over time. Version control systems generally
          allow users to revisit earlier versions of the files, compare changes
          between versions, undo changes, etc.
        </p>
        <p>Git Helps us:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Track changes across multiple files</li>
          <li>Compare versions of a project</li>
          <li>"Time travel" back to old versions</li>
          <li>Revert to a previous version</li>
          <li>Collaborate and share changes</li>
          <li>Combine changes of different versions of the same file(s)</li>
        </ul>

          Git is the version control software that runs locally on your machine.
          You don't need to register for an account. You don't need the internet
          to use it. You can use Git without ever touching Github.

          Github is a hosting platform which allows us to put files online and
          share it with others so that they can download it and then view(read)
          or make changes to it.
        </p>
        <p>To configure Git name and email use these commands:</p>
        <pre><code>$ git config -global user.name &lt;your-name&gt;
$ git config -global user.email &lt;your-email&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>To check your name and email:</p>
        <pre><code>$ git config user.name

          <h2>Creating Git Repo</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          To create a Git repo, we go to that directory and use the below
          command
        </p>
        <code>$ git init</code>
        <p>
          We can check if its created by using the command 'git status' which
          gives below message whenever we check for a newly created repo.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
$ git status 
On branch master 
No commits yet nothing to commit(create/copy files and use "git add" to track)</pre

          <h2>Git Commit</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          A commit can be considered as taking a 'snapshot' of the repo in its
          changes a moment in time. In other words, we are creating checkpoints
          to whatever changes we are making in the repo. In addition we can also
          add a message to the commit, whenever we make that commit. A typical
          Git repo has lots of commits. A commit is not the same thing as saving
          a file. Its something that works on top of saving a file. We have to
          make changes first and save them to our files before we can even
          commit. Saving a file has nothing to do with Git. But once we have
          saved those files, we can group them together into a commit.
        </p>
        <p>
          A commit is actually a multi-step process. We dont just commit.
          Instead there is an intermediate step where we actually call out the
          particular changes that we've made that we want to include in a commit
          i.e we may not want to commit all the changes made in our files but a
          subset of them. This allows us to selectively make commits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before making a commit, we need to 'stage' the files using the
          <span class="inline-code">git add</span> command. <br />For example:
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
$ git add &lt;file1&gt; &lt;file2&gt; ...
$ git status
On branch master 
Changes to be committed
  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage"
          <span>modified:  &lt;file1&gt;
          modified:  &lt;file2&gt;</span></pre>
        </code>
        <p>
          We then use the <span class="inline-code">git commit</span> command to
          commit the staged files into the repository.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
$ git commit -m "commit-message"
</pre
          >
        </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Amending_Commits">
        <header id="amend">
          <h2>Amending Commits</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Suppose you just made a commit and then realized you forgot to include
          a file. Or, maybe you made a typo in the commit message that you want
          to correct. Rather than making an all new separate commit, you can
          "redo" the previous commit using the
          <span class="inline-code">--amend</span> option. Note that this works
          only for the last recent commit which you want to fix.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default all the files will be present and we just have to save and
          close that file to amend our last commit.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          NOTE: We can add and commit in a single command using the below
          command

$ git commit -a -m "message"

        <p>
          When a team is working on a project, each one is working on separate,
          and most likely the work of one could conflict with other people's
          code. This is where branches can be used. Each commit has its own
          unique hash and each commit references at least one parent commit that
          came before it.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We can think of branches as alternative timelines for a project.
          </li>
          <li>
            Branches enable us to create separate contexts where we can try new
            things, or even work multiple ideas in parallel.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we make changes on one branch, they do not impact the other
            branches (unless we merge the changes).
          </li>

        <p>
          Even though we haven't really mentioned so far, in Git we are always
          working on some branch. And by default we are on the master branch.
          The master branch is the default branch created when we create a git
          repo (with git init). It does not do anything special and is just like
          any other branch. Many people designate the master branch as their
          "official branch" for their codebase, but that is just a matter of
          choice. From Git's perspective, the master branch is just like any
          other branch.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          NOTE: In 2020, Github renamed the default branch from master to main.
          The default Git branch name is still master.

        <p>
          The <span class="inline-code">git branch</span> command is used to
          view your existing branches of your repo. The default branch in every
          repo is master (though can can configure this). Look for the * which
          indicates the branch you are currently on.
        </p>
        <code>
          <pre>
$ git branch
<span>* master</span></pre>

          <h2>Creating and Switching Branches</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Use <span class="inline-code">git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</span> to
          make a new branch based upon the current HEAD. This just creates the
          branch, it does not switch you to that branch (the HEAD stays the
          same).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, suppose I create new branch based on the master, called
          'Bugfix' by using the command
          <span class="inline-code">git branch Bugfix</span>. The HEAD still
          points to the master because I have created the new branch 'Bugfix'
          but have not switched to it yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          To switch to a branch we can use the command
          <span class="inline-code">git switch &lt;branch-name&gt;</span>

          <h2>Deleting and Renaming Branches</h2>
        </header>
        <p>We can delete a branch by using the command:</p>
        <code>
          <pre>$ git branch -d &lt;branch-name&gt;</pre>
        </code>
        <p>
          <strong>To delete a branch, we should not be in that branch</strong>,
          so before deleting branch we need to switch to another branch. Also if
          we want to delete a branch which is not fully merged, we get a warning
          saying that the branch is not fully merged and if we still want to
          delete it we can use the command
          <span class="inline-code">git branch -D &lt;branch-name&gt;</span>.
          This command allows us to delete a branch irrespective of its merged
          status.
        </p>
        <p>We can rename a branch by using the command:</p>
        <code>
